This is my first attempt at programming a game.
You play as a sheep that's floating through space. The stars are all falling down and it's your
job to stop the star cascade by 'connecting all the dots' of the constellations. 
I'm not so much concerned with it being fun as much as it being a good, basic challenge.
Main Goals:
1. have a beam of light whenever you connect two stars, and particles float off of the 
constellation's connected lines so that it looks magical. 
2. would like the stars to stop falling when it's all connected.
3. add screenshake and 'game feel'
4. have a complete game loop (with title screen, quick tutorial sequence, levels, game over)
